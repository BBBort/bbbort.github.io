Hi, I'm **Karel Titeca** and I am passionate about board games. I have been playing them since childhood, have played hundreds of games, and have been active behind the scenes in the board game world for several years, including at Stonemaier Games, a leading American board game publisher. [More background information can be found in my bio](/karel).

I also have an eye for precision. I have years of experience with graphic programs such as Photoshop and InDesign and I find it important to work in an extremely precise and structured way on a graphic project. In combination with my IT background and my in-depth knowledge of Excel, I can generate entire card decks with great accuracy. [You can find some examples in my portfolio](/portfolio).

I offer my services through my one-man company **BortBortBort**:
-    graphic design and prepress
-    board game development
-    solo design for board games

Interested? [Feel free to contact me for a chat](/contact). If I can be of service to you, I will quickly provide you with a fair quote.
