My name is Karel and I am in love with board games since the early 80s, and I have been *completely obsessed* with board games since the board game revival of the early 2000s.

My first “new” game was the cooperative Lord of the Rings game by Reiner Knizia in 2001. Then I bought the then completely unknown game 'Carcassone' and I liked it. Then Machiavelli and from then on my girlfriend (now my wife) and I regularly visited Speelgoed Mertens in Kessel-Lo to buy a new game.

25 years later I have more than 300 games, and I freaking *love* the hobby.

Since 2018, I have also been quite busy with solo games. I love playing games with friends, but I also love solving the puzzle that is a solo game against an artificial opponent. I playtest and develop solo prototypes of new games and expansions for Stonemaier Games. I have also done a number of fan solo projects.

Since 2022, I have been the lead developer and designer for expansions for [Rolling Realms](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/305682/rolling-realms) for Stonemaier Games. I also do graphic design work for Stonemaier.

In addition to my board game work, I am active as an IT specialist and Dutch tech blogger at [Tech45](https://tech45.eu).
