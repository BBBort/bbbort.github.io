I am also the designer and developer of dozens of extensions for [Rolling Realms](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/305682/rolling-realms).

I also made some solo fan versions myself.

- [Rembrandt & Lysbeth](https://titeca.net/chartered/)


For other clients I have designed card decks, built websites, and once even made a radio broadcast. :sunglasses:
