**1–5 players | 30 minutes per player | competitive**

In **Contraptions**, you are a tinkerer who is leading the construction of a fantastic steampunk machine. Do you have what it takes to bring this enormous undertaking to a successful conclusion? Can you assemble all the parts to build your installation? Can you win over the nobles of the city? And can you find enough money and investors for your project?

In Contraptions, you try to put together the optimal hand of cards to build your installation card by card. Each turn, you choose whether you want to “Recycle,” “Exchange” or “Build” a card from your hand. When an installation is finished, the owner of the best-functioning machine in the best-run workshop wins the game.

**Status of the game design**: I have been developing and improving Contraptions for over a year now and after dozens of playtests and much advice from friends in the board game industry, I am now ready for the fourth major version. The basis of the game has been sound for a long time, but now I am focusing mainly on replayability and thematic development.
